# Networks and Network Security

This section of the portfolio focuses on **network security analysis, incident response, and preventive hardening**.  
The projects simulate real-world scenarios where different types of network-based attacks or vulnerabilities were investigated, documented, and mitigated.  
Each folder contains supporting logs (e.g., `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`) and written analysis reports in PDF format.
