# SYN Flood Attack â€“ Network Traffic Analysis

This project simulates the investigation of a SYN flood attack on a travel agencyâ€™s website. As a security analyst, you identify the cause of a website outage, analyze captured network traffic, and prepare findings for management.

## Scenario
You work as a security analyst for a travel agency that promotes vacation packages on its website. Employees regularly access the companyâ€™s sales page to help customers find deals.

One afternoon, your monitoring system sends an alert indicating a web server issue. Attempting to access the site results in a **connection timeout** error. Using a packet sniffer, you detect a high volume of **TCP SYN requests** from an unfamiliar IP address, overwhelming the serverâ€™s capacity to respond.  

To mitigate the issue, you:
- Temporarily take the server offline to allow recovery
- Block the malicious IP address in the firewall
- Prepare an incident analysis for your manager detailing the type of attack and its impact

## Attack Identification

**Section 1 â€“ Type of Attack**  
The evidence indicates the web server was subjected to a **SYN flood attack**, a type of **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** attack.  
- Connection timeouts began after a sudden surge of TCP SYN requests from a single unknown IP address.
- Packet capture logs confirm the abnormal traffic pattern.

## Attack Impact

**Section 2 â€“ How the Attack Caused the Website to Malfunction**  
The attack exploited the TCP **three-way handshake** process:  
1. **SYN** â€“ The client sends a SYN packet to initiate a connection.  
2. **SYN-ACK** â€“ The server acknowledges and reserves resources for the connection.  
3. **ACK** â€“ The client completes the handshake, establishing the session.  

In a SYN flood:
- The attacker sends a massive number of SYN packets without completing the handshake.
- The server reserves resources for each pending connection, quickly exhausting available ports.
- Legitimate connection attempts fail, resulting in website downtime for both customers and employees.

Captured logs show:
- **Green:** Normal TCP handshakes  
- **Red:** Attack activity (large volume of SYN requests)  
- **Yellow:** Legitimate TCP connections failing due to resource exhaustion caused by the attack
