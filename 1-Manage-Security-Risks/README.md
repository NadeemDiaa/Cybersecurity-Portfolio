## Risk Assessment

**Risk Description**  
Botium Toys lacks adequate asset management and several essential security controls, placing it at risk of non-compliance with both U.S. and international standards.  

**Control Best Practices**  
In line with the NIST CSFâ€™s *Identify* function, Botium Toys should classify all assets, evaluate their criticality, and determine the potential impact of their loss on business continuity.

**Risk Score**  
**8/10** â€“ High risk, due to missing controls and incomplete compliance measures.  

**Additional Comments**  
The potential impact from asset loss is considered *medium* because the IT department does not have a full inventory of at-risk assets. However, the risk of regulatory penalties or sensitive data exposure is *high* due to missing compliance safeguards.  

**Specific Details:**
- All employees have access to internally stored data, including cardholder data and customersâ€™ PII/SPII.  
- No encryption for stored or transmitted credit card data.  
- Least privilege and separation of duties not implemented.  
- Data integrity controls in place; firewall properly configured.  
- Antivirus software installed and monitored.  
- No intrusion detection system (IDS) deployed.  
- No disaster recovery plan or critical data backups in place.  
- EU breach notification policy in place (72-hour requirement).  
- Privacy policies and procedures are documented and enforced.  
- Password policy exists but lacks strong complexity requirements.
