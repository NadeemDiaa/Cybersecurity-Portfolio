# Organizational Security Audit – Botium Toys

## Summary
Botium Toys is undergoing a cybersecurity audit with the primary goal of assessing its overall security program, aligning it with industry standards and best practices, and providing mitigation recommendations for vulnerabilities classified as *high risk*. The audit also aims to present an overarching strategy for enhancing the organization’s security posture. The audit team is responsible for documenting findings, providing remediation plans, and maintaining clear, consistent communication with stakeholders.

## Scope
The audit scope is defined as the **entire security program** at Botium Toys. This encompasses all assets, infrastructure, and internal processes, including:

- **On-premises business equipment** for in-office operations  
- **Employee equipment** such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, and surveillance cameras  
- **Storefront products** available for in-person and online retail, stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse  
- **Systems, software, and services** including accounting, telecommunication, database, security, e-commerce, and inventory management  
- **Internet access** and network connectivity points  
- **Internal network** architecture and security controls  
- **Data retention and storage** solutions and associated policies  
- **Legacy system maintenance** for end-of-life systems requiring human oversight  

The scope also includes reviewing current **user permissions**, **implemented controls**, and **established procedures** across core systems, ensuring alignment with applicable compliance requirements, and verifying accountability of all technology assets.

## Goals
- **Adherence to NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF):** Align Botium Toys’ security practices with NIST CSF to establish a strong cybersecurity foundation.  
- **Process Improvement for Compliance:** Develop effective processes to ensure systems meet all relevant regulations and standards.  
- **Fortification of System Controls:** Strengthen technical and administrative controls to enhance the organization’s security posture.  
- **Implementation of Least Privilege:** Apply least-privilege principles to user account management, granting only the access necessary for each role.  
- **Policy and Procedure Establishment:** Create and document comprehensive cybersecurity policies, procedures, and incident response playbooks.  
- **Compliance Assurance:** Confirm that all systems, processes, and controls meet required compliance standards to protect sensitive data and maintain regulatory adherence.

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Description**  
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

**Control Best Practices**  
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is *Identify*. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

**Risk Score**  
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is **8** (high) due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.

**Additional Comments**  
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as *medium* because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is *high* because Botium Toys does not have all necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to compliance regulations that safeguard critical data.  

**Specific Findings:**
- All employees currently have access to internally stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII.  
- No encryption is used for customers’ credit card information accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally.  
- Access controls for least privilege and separation of duties are not implemented.  
- IT department has ensured availability and integrated controls to maintain data integrity.  
- Firewall in place with well-defined security rules.  
- Antivirus software installed and regularly monitored.  
- No intrusion detection system (IDS) implemented.  
- No disaster recovery plans or critical data backups in place.  
- EU breach notification process established within 72 hours.  
- Privacy policies and procedures in place, enforced across IT and other staff.  
- Existing password policy does not meet current complexity requirements.  
- No centralized password management system, leading to delays in password resets.  
- Legacy systems monitored and maintained, but without a formal schedule or defined intervention process.  
- Physical premises have strong security measures: locks, CCTV, fire detection, and prevention systems.

## Conclusion
This audit represents a critical step in ensuring Botium Toys is prepared to identify, mitigate, and manage cybersecurity risks. By addressing vulnerabilities, aligning operations with industry frameworks, and implementing stronger controls, the organization will reduce exposure to threats, protect its assets and customer data, and reinforce stakeholder trust. The findings and recommendations from this assessment will act as a roadmap for sustaining and continuously improving Botium Toys’ cybersecurity posture.
